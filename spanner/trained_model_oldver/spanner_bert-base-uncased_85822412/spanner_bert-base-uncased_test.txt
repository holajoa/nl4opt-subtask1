A grocery store sushi supplier makes sushi in bulk and can purchase either an all - in - one manufacturing line or a decoupled manufacturing line . The all - in - one manufacturing line is more efficient and can output 10000 orders per day while the decoupled manufacturing line can output 7000 items per day . The all - in - one manufacturing line requires 5 workers per day while the decoupled manufacturing line requires 10 workers per day . The grocery store sushi supplier must be able to satisfy at least 150000 orders per day and has allocated a budget to hire 135 workers . Since the decoupled manufacturing line is less efficient , at most 35 % of the production can be decoupled manufacturing lines . However , there are some legacy factories remaining that already have decoupled manufacturing lines and about 10 % of workers are trained on these older methods . Therefore , at least 10 % must be decoupled manufacturing lines .

A skiing resort has two methods of getting their customers up to their resort . They can either use a gondola , or a large bus . On average , a gondola can transport skiers and snowboarders at a rate of 20 people per minute whereas a large bus can transport at a rate of 5 people per minute . However , gondolas cost the resort a lot to maintain and at most 40 % of the transportation methods implemented can be gondolas .

A shuttle bus costs $ 20 and carries 7 workers , whereas a taxi service costs $ 50 and carries 5 workers . The manufacturing plant has to transport at least 250 workers and at most 5 shuttle buses can be used .

A composting company can store compost in medium containers and large containers . A medium container needs to be checked 5 times a week and can store 25 units of compost . A large container needs to be checked 2 times a week and can store 40 units of compost . The company needs to store at least 500 units of compost and there must be at least 3 medium containers . There must also be at least 2 large containers and the number of large containers must be three times as much as the number of medium containers .

An airport can transport travelers using commercial planes and private planes . A commercial plane can carry 180 travelers while a private plane can carry 30 travelers . Because the destination is more remote , there are few airport runways . Therefore , there must be twice as many private planes as commercial planes . If the airport needs to transport at least 3500 travelers , how many of each type of planes should be used to minimize the total number of planes used .	commercial planes:: 6,8:: VAR:: VAR	private planes:: 9,11:: VAR:: VAR	commercial plane:: 13,15:: VAR:: VAR	180:: 17,18:: PARAM:: PARAM	private plane:: 21,23:: VAR:: VAR	30:: 25,26:: PARAM:: PARAM	travelers:: 26,27:: O:: OBJ_NAME	must be:: 44,46:: CONST_DIR:: O	twice:: 46,47:: PARAM:: PARAM	private planes:: 49,51:: VAR:: VAR	commercial planes:: 52,54:: VAR:: VAR	at least:: 61,63:: CONST_DIR:: CONST_DIR	3500:: 63,64:: LIMIT:: LIMIT	minimize:: 77,78:: OBJ_DIR:: OBJ_DIR	total number of planes:: 79,83:: OBJ_NAME:: O	number of planes:: 80,83:: O:: OBJ_NAME	
A gas company can transport gas using a pipeline or by train . A pipeline can carry 8000 units of gas and a train can carry 2000 units of gas every day . Due to recent environmental changes , the number of trains used must be at least twice as many as the number of pipelines . If at least 1000000 units of gas needs to be transported every day , minimize the total number of pipelines and trains needed .	pipeline:: 8,9:: VAR:: VAR	train:: 11,12:: VAR:: VAR	pipeline:: 14,15:: VAR:: VAR	8000:: 17,18:: PARAM:: PARAM	train:: 23,24:: VAR:: VAR	2000:: 26,27:: PARAM:: PARAM	trains:: 42,43:: VAR:: VAR	at least:: 46,48:: CONST_DIR:: CONST_DIR	twice:: 48,49:: PARAM:: PARAM	pipelines:: 55,56:: VAR:: VAR	at least:: 58,60:: CONST_DIR:: CONST_DIR	1000000:: 60,61:: LIMIT:: LIMIT	minimize:: 71,72:: OBJ_DIR:: OBJ_DIR	pipelines:: 76,77:: O:: VAR	trains:: 78,79:: O:: VAR
